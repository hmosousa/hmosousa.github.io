## Research Projects

- **CHPVVC**  
  Sep 2023 — Present  
  The goal of this project is to produce a dashboard that compiles all the information regarding a patient to be used by the medical staff of the Hospital of Póvoa de Varzim and Vila do Conde (CHPVVC) that do Domiciliary visits. My role is to develop the natural language processing pipeline that will extract biomedical entities and relations between them from the multiple clinical documents.

- **StorySense**  
  Jul 2023 — Present  
  The StorySense project is the sequel of Text2Story. While in the first project, we were concerned with extracting the information in a structured manner, in the StorySense project we are more focused on the meaning (sense) of each component of the narrative. My role in this project is as an assistant researcher, looking for a deeper encoding of temporal information.

- **MINE4HEALTH**  
  Jan 2020 — Nov 2021  
  As a member of the NLP team, I contributed to the MINE4HEALTH project developed by INESC TEC in collaboration with the Portuguese Institute of Oncology of Porto - Francisco Gentil (IPO Porto). The project focused on using text-mining and natural language processing techniques to extract structured information from clinical documents. This effort aimed to enhance decision-making within oncological contexts by providing healthcare professionals with easily accessible panels containing crucial patient data, including health status, pathological history, biometric information, exams, and diagnoses. By streamlining the consultation process and enabling data-driven insights, the project not only reduces redundancy and treatment time but also supports the comparison of treatment effectiveness and adherence to international protocols.

- **Text2Story**  
  Dec 2020 — Jun 2023  
  Member of the project Text2Story: Extracting journalistic narratives from text and representing them in a narrative modeling language. As a Ph.D. student, my contributions to this project were mainly concerned the extraction of temporal information from text. This includes the temporal entities - such as events, temporal expressions, or participants - and temporal relations that hold between them - such as before, after, or simultaneous.
